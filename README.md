Design Principles:

- Separation of concerns (data vs presentation)
- Minimal surface area for API routes
- Immutable, typed content modules

---

## 8. API Surface

Comprehensive API endpoints with security-first design:

| Endpoint         | Purpose                                           | Notes                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/api/about`     | Returns profile / about metadata                  | Static + typed                    |
| `/api/blog`      | Blog content management and retrieval             | Prisma + Zod                      |
| `/api/github`    | Fetches GitHub profile + repos (filtered)         | Tokenized (env)                   |
| `/api/pagespeed` | Surfaces PageSpeed metrics                        | Enhanced caching + error handling |
| `/api/chatbot`   | Interactive AI chatbot (Reem) for visitor queries | Gemini + Groq fallback            |
| `/api/admin`     | Administrative operations for content             | Secured endpoints                 |

Controls:

- Input validation & schema constraints with Zod

- Type-safe database operations via Prisma ORM
- Enhanced security headers and CSP compliance

---

## 9. Security & Hardening

Last internal assessment: 2025‑09 (latest iteration) — no known unresolved critical/high issues.

Implemented Layers (expanded in 4.11.15):

1. Transport & Headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options (deny), Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
2. Application: Sanitized inputs, explicit error redaction, avoidance of `eval` / dangerous DOM sinks, reinforced type gates (locale / SEO literal unions) reducing unchecked paths.
3. Operational: Secrets confined to environment variables; repository free of credentials.
4. Abuse Mitigation: IP‑scoped rate limiting on sensitive endpoints with enhanced Zod validation.
5. Dependency Hygiene: Routine audit (npm audit) — zero known CVEs at last scan; periodic verification of transitive packages relevant to security headers & i18n.
6. Automated Security: CodeQL Advanced Security Scanning for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python with multi-language matrix analysis.
7. Dependency Security: Automated dependency review workflows blocking vulnerable dependencies in pull requests.

Security Posture Snapshot:

- Critical: 0
- High: 0
- Medium: 0
- Low/Informational: Monitored
- Automated Scanning: Active (CodeQL + Dependency Review)

---

```typescript
// ✅ Correct import for Prisma 7
import { PrismaClient } from "@/lib/generated/prisma/client";
import type { Prisma } from "@/lib/generated/prisma/client";

// ❌ Old import (Prisma 6 and below)
import { PrismaClient } from "@/lib/generated/prisma";
```
