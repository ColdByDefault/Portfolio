# About Me  

Hey! I’m Yazan, but online, I go by **coldbydefault**. I’m a passionate beginner in software development, and I’m currently a **student** learning the ins and outs of programming.  

## My Tech Journey  

I’ve been diving into the world of development, focusing on modern web technologies and frameworks. I primarily work with:  

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Flask (occasionally)  
- **Database:** MongoDB, Supabase, SQLite, SQL, PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools:** GitHub, VSC, Jira.

One of my main projects is **beRich.Hub** — a full-stack Next.js app where I’m rebuilding from scratch to migrate from GitHub Pages to Firebase Hosting for backend support.  


## My Philosophy  

I believe in building practical solutions while continuously learning new skills. Whether it's creating full-stack apps or experimenting with frontend designs, I’m always looking for ways to push my limits and grow as a developer.
