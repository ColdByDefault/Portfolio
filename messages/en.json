I specialize in Next.js, React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and maintain an active presence on GitHub. When tackling new challenges, I dive straight into the docs and experiment until I've mastered the tools. Driven by a passion for a cleaner, more open web, I contribute to open-source projects and aim to streamline user experiences free of unnecessary ads and paywalls. My goal is to grow into a full-stack expert—particularly in Next.js, LLM integrations, and end-to-end web application development. I believe hard work and discipline always pay off, and I bring that focus to every project, big or small.",
